# Debt-Finance-PH
 This project provides a venue for current readers to review and provide comment on my current working paper entitled "Is Debt Finance Deficit Better than Tax Revenue" the goal of the research is to provide context on current public debates on fiscal policy measures such as increasing debt and tax reforms in the Philippines. I am currently working on the small scale New Keynesian models and using DYNARE to solved for different shock responses of the variables in the model.
